"""Standardised setup.py for templated python package projects.

This setup.py is intended only to be used with the included build scripts.

To use this file, you should only need to update the values in the constants
section. Everything should then be handled for you.

The configuration constants are arranged into 3 sections:
- Basic Configuration:
    The most commonly used setup arguments.

- Intermediate Configuration:
    Less commonly used setup arguments. In a different section to avoid clutter.

- Advanced Configuration:
    Arguments that could break everything because of assumptions built into the
    template.
